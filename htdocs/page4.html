                <h2 class="titles">The Necklace</h2>
		<ul> <!--An unordered list indents whole paragraphs without extra CSS.-->
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">The girl was one of those pretty and charming young creatures who sometimes are born, as if by a slip of fate, into a family of clerks. She had no dowry, no expectations, no way of being known, understood, loved, married by any rich and distinguished man; so she let herself be married to a little clerk of the Ministry of Public Instruction.</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She dressed plainly because she could not dress well, but she was unhappy as if she had really fallen from a higher station; since with women there is neither caste nor rank, for beauty, grace and charm take the place of family and birth. Natural ingenuity, instinct for what is elegant, a supple mind are their sole hierarchy, and often make of women of the people the equals of the very greatest ladies.</li><br>
	             <li class="nonTitles noBullets">Mathilde suffered ceaselessly, feeling herself born to enjoy all delicacies and all luxuries. She was distressed at the poverty of her dwelling, at the bareness of the walls, at the shabby chairs, the ugliness of the curtains. All those things, of which another woman of her rank would never even have been conscious, tortured her and made her angry. The sight of the little Breton peasant who did her humble housework aroused in her despairing regrets and bewildering dreams. She thought of silent antechambers hung with Oriental tapestry, illumined by tall bronze candelabra, and of two great footmen in knee breeches who sleep in the big armchairs, made drowsy by the oppressive heat of the stove. She thought of long reception halls hung with ancient silk, of the dainty cabinets containing priceless curiosities and of the little coquettish perfumed reception rooms made for chatting at five o'clock with intimate friends, with men famous and sought after, whom all women envy and whose attention they all desire.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">When she sat down to dinner, before the round table covered with a tablecloth in use three days, opposite her husband, who uncovered the soup tureen and declared with a delighted air, "Ah, the good soup! I don't know anything better than that," she thought of dainty dinners, of shining silverware, of tapestry that peopled the walls with ancient personages and with strange birds flying in the midst of a fairy forest; and she thought of delicious dishes served on marvellous plates and of the whispered gallantries to which you listen with a sphinxlike smile while you are eating the pink meat of a trout or the wings of a quail.</li><br>
	             <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She had no gowns, no jewels, nothing. And she loved nothing but that. She felt made for that. She would have liked so much to please, to be envied, to be charming, to be sought after.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She had a friend, a former schoolmate at the convent, who was rich, and whom she did not like to go to see any more because she felt so sad when she came home.</li><br>
	             <li class="nonTitles noBullets">But one evening her husband reached home with a triumphant air and holding a large envelope in his hand.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"There," said he, "there is something for you."</li><br>
	             <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She tore the paper quickly and drew out a printed card which bore these words: the Minister of Public Instruction and Madame Georges Ramponneau request the honor of M. and Madame Loisel's company at the palace of the Ministry on Monday evening, January 18th.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">Instead of being delighted, as her husband had hoped, she threw the invitation on the table crossly, muttering:</li><br>
	             <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"What do you wish me to do with that?"</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"Why, my dear, I thought you would be glad. You never go out, and this is such a fine opportunity. I had great trouble to get it. Every one wants to go; it is very select, and they are not giving many invitations to clerks. The whole official world will be there."</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She looked at him with an irritated glance and said impatiently:</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"And what do you wish me to put on my back?"</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">He had not thought of that. He stammered:</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"Why, the gown you go to the theatre in. It looks very well to me."</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">He stopped, distracted, seeing that his wife was weeping. Two great tears ran slowly from the corners of her eyes toward the corners of her mouth.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"What's the matter? What's the matter?" he answered.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">By a violent effort she conquered her grief and replied in a calm voice, while she wiped her wet cheeks:</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"Nothing. Only I have no gown, and, therefore, I can't go to this ball. Give your card to some colleague whose wife is better equipped than I am."</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">He was in despair. He resumed:</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"Come, let us see, Mathilde. How much would it cost, a suitable gown, which you could use on other occasions--something very simple?"</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She reflected several seconds, making her calculations and wondering also what sum she could ask without drawing on herself an immediate refusal and a frightened exclamation from the economical clerk.</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">Finally she replied hesitating:</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"I don't know exactly, but I think I could manage it with four hundred francs."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">He grew a little pale, because he was laying aside just that amount to buy a gun and treat himself to a little shooting next summer on the plain of Nanterre, with several friends who went to shoot larks there of a Sunday.</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">But he said:</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"Very well. I will give you four hundred francs. And try to have a pretty gown."</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">The day of the ball drew near and Madame Loisel seemed sad, uneasy, anxious. Her frock was ready, however. Her husband said to her one evening:</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"What is the matter? Come, you have seemed very queer these last three days."</li><br>
		     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">And she answered:</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"It annoys me not to have a single piece of jewelry, not a single ornament, nothing to put on. I shall look poverty-stricken. I would almost rather not go at all."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"You might wear natural flowers," said her husband. "They're very stylish at this time of year. For ten francs you can get two or three magnificent roses."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She was not convinced.</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"No; there's nothing more humiliating than to look poor among other women who are rich."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"How stupid you are!" her husband cried. "Go look up your friend, Madame Forestier, and ask her to lend you some jewels. You're intimate enough with her to do that."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">She uttered a cry of joy:</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"True! I never thought of it."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">The next day she went to her friend and told her of her distress. Madame Forestier went to a wardrobe with a mirror, took out a large jewel box, brought it back, opened it and said to Madame Loisel:</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets">"Choose, my dear."</li><br>
                     <li class="nonTitles noBullets"></li><br>
